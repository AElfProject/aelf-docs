### 4. What is the history of aelf? 
The story of aelf began on 10 December 2017, when aelf's vision and plans were introduced to global investors at a Coindesk conference. aelf successfully completed its fund-raising significantly ahead of schedule, having secured investments from notable institutions such as [Arrington Capital](https://www.arringtoncapital.com/), [Draper Dragon](https://draperdragon.com/), [Galaxy Digital](https://www.galaxy.com/) etc.

In the same month, the ELF token was listed on six major exchanges, including [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/aelf) and [OKEX](https://www.okx.com/trade-spot/elf-usdt). aelf Testnet was successfully launched in 2018, followed by another successful launch of the Mainnet in 2020.

aelf is primarily a multi-chain parallel computing blockchain network which was created to address several of the limitations of traditional blockchain systems, such as performance bottlenecks and data complexity. aelf's vision is to be a "Linux Ecosystem" equivalent for a blockchain that incorporates state-of-the-art IT design principles, which in particular allows developers to customise Chains to meet their own needs. For further details on aelf's original design and architecture, please kindly refer to aelf's [original whitepaper](pathname:///pdf/aelf_whitepaper_v1.7_en.pdf).

### 5. What makes aelf different from other blockchains? Why is aelf unique? 
aelf's unique strength lies in its underlying architecture, which utilises a multi-layered structure comprising a MainChain and multiple SideChains. This differs from a traditional Single Chain system in that aelf is a "Branched Ecosystem", where the MainChain works as the backbone of the system and connects to multiple SideChains. Compared with the traditional "one Chain to any type of Contract", aelf's "One Chain to one type of Contract" design allows aelf to distribute tasks efficiently and process transactions in parallel, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing congestion. At the same time, the SideChains are easier to manage and can be tailored for specific applications, enabling aelf to support a wide range of use cases without compromising performance.

The [C# programming language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) forms the foundation of the entire aelf blockchain, which underpins aelf's ability to handle high transaction volumes and complex operations with ease. C# also offers a powerful foundation for AI integration in blockchain development, primarily due to its alignment with the [.NET ecosystem](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), which provides a wide range of libraries and tools that facilitate the development of sophisticated AI models, including the integration of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and data analytics. The integration of AI into the aelf ecosystem marks a significant advancement in the blockchain’s operational capabilities which not only optimises performance and security, but also plays a crucial role in transitioning mass Web2 users to Web3 by significantly improving the overall user and developer experience.

For more information regarding what makes aelf the preferred choice for developers and users, please refer to our [Whitepaper v2](https://docs.aelf.com/resources/whitepaper-2/).
