### 12. What success stories can you share about aelf's partners?

:::faq[What success stories can you share about aelf's partners?]

One of the notable success stories involving aelf's partners is [Project Schrodinger](http://schrodingernft.ai/). Built on the aelf blockchain, Project Schrodinger is the world's first 404 NFT AI Project, an innovative initiative that combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with the growing trend of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

**AI-Generated Art**: The core of Project Schrodinger involves AI algorithms that generate unique pieces of digital art. These algorithms are designed to create artworks that are not only visually appealing but also carry distinct characteristics that make each piece one-of-a-kind.

**Dynamic Evolution**: Unlike traditional NFTs that remain static once minted, the NFTs in Project Schrodinger are designed to evolve. The AI continuously updates and modifies the artwork based on various inputs and conditions, ensuring that the NFTs change and grow over time, adding an element of surprise and ongoing interest for collectors.

**Blockchain Integration**: By leveraging the aelf blockchain, Project Schrodinger ensures that all transactions related to the creation, sale, and transfer of NFTs are secure, transparent, and immutable. The blockchain's high performance and scalability support the project's need for efficient processing and robust security.

### 15. Do aelf ecosystem DApps use tokens on the MainChain or SideChain? When staking and earning rewards on aelf ecosystem DApps, are these staked tokens and reward tokens on the MainChain or SideChain? If I do not have any tokens on the SideChain, do I need to transfer them from the MainChain first?

:::faq[Do aelf ecosystem DApps use tokens on the MainChain or SideChain? When staking and earning rewards on aelf ecosystem DApps, are these staked tokens and reward tokens on the MainChain or SideChain? If I do not have any tokens on the SideChain, do I need to transfer them from the MainChain first?]

Some aelf ecosystem DApps, like Portkey Wallet, ETransfer, and eBridge, can use tokens on either the MainChain or SideChain, while other DApps, like Awaken and Forest, only support the SideChain, depending on the specific application and its design. Generally, more complex operations, such as DApp interactions, are often handled on SideChains to enhance scalability and reduce congestion on the MainChain.

Typically, when you stake tokens or earn rewards through staking and voting on aelf governance, these activities are carried out on the MainChain. However, if you stake tokens or earn rewards through ecosystem DApps, it depends on the specific rules of those DApps; most of them are carried out on the SideChain.

If the DApp you are interacting with requires tokens on the SideChain, and you currently only have tokens on the MainChain, you will need to transfer those tokens from the MainChain to the SideChain first. This transfer can usually be done within your Portkey Wallet.
