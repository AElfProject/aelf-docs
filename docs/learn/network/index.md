# Network

## Introduction
The network layer in aelf is vital for maintaining connections and communication between nodes. It supports higher-level logic like synchronization and allows node operators to monitor and manage network operations. aelf uses gRPC for connections to keep the design simple and flexible.

## Architecture
The network consists of three layers:

1. **aelf.OS**
   - Handles network events.
   - Runs background tasks for network operations.

2. **aelf.OS.Core.Network**
   - Provides services to higher levels.
   - Defines infrastructure components and types.

3. **aelf.OS.Network.Grpc**
   - Implements the infrastructure layer using gRPC.
   - Manages low-level functions like serialization and retrying.

### aelf.OS
This layer monitors and handles network-related events:
- **Transaction Accepted Event**: When a transaction is verified.
- **Block Mined Event**: When a block is packaged.
- **Block Accepted Event**: When a block is executed successfully.
- **New Irreversible Block Found Event**: When a new irreversible block is found.

It also performs regular tasks:
- **Peer Health Check**: Ensures connected peers are healthy.
- **Peer Retry Connection**: Attempts to reconnect with unhealthy peers.
- **Network Node Discovery**: Finds new nodes.

### aelf.OS.Core.Network
This core module includes:

- Application layer implementation:
   - **NetworkService**: Manages sending/receiving requests, broadcasting items to peers, and handling network exceptions.

- Infrastructure layer implementation and definition:
   - **IPeerPool/PeerPool**: Manages active peer connections.
   - **IPeer**: Defines peer interactions and metrics.
   - **IaelfNetworkServer**: Manages network lifecycle and connections.

- Definitions of types (network_types.proto and partial).

- Defines the event that should be launched from the infrastructure layerâ€™s implementation.

### aelf.OS.Network.Grpc
Implements the infrastructure layer using gRPC:
- **GrpcPeer**: Implements `IPeer`.
- **GrpcStreamPeer**: Client-side `IPeer` implementation (node version >=1.4.0).
- **GrpcStreamBackPeer**: Server-side `IPeer` implementation (node version >=1.4.0).
- **GrpcNetworkServer**: Implements `IaelfNetworkServer`.
- **GrpcServerService**: Manages network service interfaces and data exchange.

Extra functionalities include:
- Serializing and deserializing requests.
- Implementing request/response mechanisms.
- Authentication.

## Protocol
Nodes use a defined network interface protocol for normal operation and data synchronization.

### Connection

#### DoHandshake
When a node connects, it exchanges handshake information. This includes chain status, current height, and more.

- **Request**: 
    ```cs
    rpc DoHandshake (HandshakeRequest) returns (HandshakeReply) {}
    ```
- **Handshake Message**:
    ```protobuf
    message Handshake {
        HandshakeData handshake_data = 1;
        bytes signature = 2;
        bytes session_id = 3;
    }
    ```

    - **handshake_data**: the data of handshake.
    - **signature**: the signatrue of handshake data.
    - **session_id**: randomly generated ids when nodes connect.


- **HandshakeData Message**:
    ```protobuf
    message HandshakeData {
        int32 chain_id = 1;

        bytes pubkey = 4;
        aelf.Hash best_chain_hash = 5;
        int64 best_chain_height = 6;
        aelf.Hash last_irreversible_block_hash = 7;
