### Configure Connect Wallet Function

**Step 1: Locate the File**

- Go to the `src/components/layout/header/index.tsx` file.

**Step 2: Write the Connect Wallet Function**

- The `header/index.tsx` file is the header of our NFT dApp. It allows users to connect their Portkey wallet with the NFT dApp.

- Before users can interact with the smart contract, we need to write the `Connect Wallet` function.

- Find the comment `// Step C - Connect Portkey Wallet`.

- Replace the existing connect function with this code snippet:

```tsx title="header/index.tsx"
const connect = async (walletProvider?: IPortkeyProvider) => {
  // Step C - Connect Portkey Wallet
  const accounts = await (walletProvider ? walletProvider : provider)?.request({
    method: MethodsBase.REQUEST_ACCOUNTS,
  });
  const account = accounts?.AELF && accounts?.AELF[0];
  if (account) {
    setCurrentWalletAddress(account.replace(/^ELF_/, "").replace(/_AELF$/, ""));
    setIsConnected(true);
  }
  !walletProvider && toast.success("Successfully connected");
};
```
**Explanation:**
- **`connect`** **Function** : This function connects the user's Portkey wallet with the dApp.
  - **Fetch Accounts** : It fetches the wallet accounts using the provider.
  - **Log Accounts** : Logs the accounts to the console for debugging.
  - **Set Wallet Address** : Sets the current wallet address state variable with the fetched account.
  - **Update Connection Status** : Updates the state to indicate that the wallet is connected.
  - **User Notification** : Displays an alert to notify the user that their wallet is successfully connected.
In this code, we fetch the Portkey wallet account using the provider and update the wallet address state variable. An alert notifies the user that their wallet is successfully connected.
With the Connect Wallet function defined, we're ready to write the remaining functions in the next steps.
