title: Tic-Tac-Toe dApp
description: Moderately difficult smart contract and dApp
---

**Description**: The Tic-Tac-Toe dApp is a decentralized gamify application that allows users to play the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe on the aelf blockchain. It offers a simple and interactive interface where two players can compete against each other, with game data securely stored and verified on the aelf blockchain.

**Purpose**: The purpose of the Tic-Tac-Toe gamify dApp is to demonstrate how traditional games can be implemented on the aelf blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability of game outcomes. It serves as an educational tool for learning smart contract development and the basics of decentralized application functionality.

**Difficulty Level**: Moderate
