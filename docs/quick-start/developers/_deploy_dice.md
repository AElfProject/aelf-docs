#### Acquire Testnet Tokens (Faucet) for Development

To deploy smart contracts or execute on-chain transactions on aelf, you'll require testnet ELF tokens.

**Get ELF Tokens**

Go to https://faucet-ui.aelf.dev Enter your address and click `Get Tokens`.

**Deploy Smart Contract:**

The smart contract needs to be deployed on the chain before users can interact with it.

Run the following command to deploy a contract. Remember to export the path of DiceMaster.dll.patched to CONTRACT_PATH.

<TabItem value="Linux and macOs" label="Linux and macOs" default>
```bash title="Terminal"
export CONTRACT_PATH=$(find ~+ . -path "*patched*" | head -n 1)
```

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-deploy -a $WALLET_ADDRESS -p $WALLET_PASSWORD -c $CONTRACT_PATH -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io/
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">
```bash title="Command Prompt"
$CONTRACT_PATH = Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*patched*" | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty FullName
$env:CONTRACT_PATH = $CONTRACT_PATH
```

```bash title="Command Prompt"
aelf-deploy -a $env:WALLET_ADDRESS -p $env:WALLET_PASSWORD -c $env:CONTRACT_PATH -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io/
```

</TabItem>
