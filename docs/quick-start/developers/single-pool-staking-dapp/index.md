title: Single Pool Staking dApp
description: Moderately difficult DeFi smart contract and dApp
---

**Description**: The Single Pool Staking dApp is a decentralized application built on the aelf blockchain that allows users to stake their tokens in a single staking pool. Users can earn rewards based on the amount and duration of their staked assets, with staking and reward distribution processes fully automated and secured by blockchain technology. The dApp offers a transparent and simple interface for users to monitor their staked assets and track reward accumulation over time.

**Purpose**: The Single Pool Staking dApp aims to demonstrate the seamless integration of staking mechanisms with blockchain, providing users with a secure, transparent, and efficient way to grow their holdings. It serves as an educational tool for learning about staking contracts and their role in decentralized finance (DeFi), while showcasing the potential of blockchain technology for creating decentralized financial services that offer fairness and trustless reward distribution.

**Difficulty Level**: Moderate
