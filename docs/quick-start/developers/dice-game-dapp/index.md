title: Dice Game dApp
description: Moderately complex smart contract
---

**Description**: This contract is moderately complex. It demonstrates the use of
state variables, user interactions, and random number generation using Aetherlink VRF to create a dice game where users can bet on the outcome of the dice roll. Aetherlink is a decentralized oracle network on aelf blockchain.

**Purpose**: To introduce you to more advanced concepts such as state management, event handling, and randomization using oracle networks in smart contracts.

**Difficulty Level**: Moderate
