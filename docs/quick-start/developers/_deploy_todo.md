#### Create A Wallet

To send transactions on the aelf blockchain, you must have a wallet.

- Run this command to create aelf wallet.

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-command create
```

- You will be prompted to save your account, please do **save** your account as shown below:

```bash title="Terminal"
? Save account info into a file? (Y/n) Y
```

**Make sure to choose Y to save your account information.**

:::tip
‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: If you do not save your account information (by selecting n or N), do not export the wallet password. Only **proceed to the next** step if you have saved your account information.
:::

- Next, enter and confirm your password. Then export your wallet password as shown below:

```bash title="Terminal"
export WALLET_PASSWORD="YOUR_WALLET_PASSWORD"
```

#### Acquire Testnet Tokens (Faucet) for Development

To deploy smart contracts or execute on-chain transactions on aelf, you'll require testnet ELF tokens.

**Get ELF Tokens**

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI" default>

**1. Get Testnet ELF Tokens:**

To receive testnet ELF tokens, run this command after replacing `$WALLET_ADDRESS` and `$WALLET_PASSWORD` with your wallet details:

```bash title="Terminal"
export WALLET_ADDRESS="YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"
curl -X POST "https://faucet.aelf.dev/api/claim?walletAddress=$WALLET_ADDRESS" -H "accept: application/json" -d ""
```

**2. Check ELF Balance:**

To check your ELF balance, use:

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-command call ASh2Wt7nSEmYqnGxPPzp4pnVDU4uhj1XW9Se5VeZcX2UDdyjx -a $WALLET_ADDRESS -p $WALLET_PASSWORD -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io GetBalance
```

You will be prompted for the following:

```sh title="Terminal"
Enter the required param <symbol>: ELF
Enter the required param <owner>: **$WALLET_ADDRESS**
```

You should see the result displaying your wallet's ELF balance.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="web" label="Web" default>

Go to https://faucet-ui.aelf.dev Enter your address and click `Get Tokens`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Deploy Smart Contract:**

The smart contract needs to be deployed on the chain before users can interact with it.

Run the following command to deploy a contract. Remember to export the path of ToDoApp.dll.patched to CONTRACT_PATH.

```bash title="Terminal"
export CONTRACT_PATH=$(find ~+ . -path "*patched*" | head -n 1)
```

```bash title="Terminal"
aelf-deploy -a $WALLET_ADDRESS -p $WALLET_PASSWORD -c $CONTRACT_PATH -e https://tdvw-test-node.aelf.io/
```

- Please wait for approximately 1 to 2 minutes. If the deployment is successful, it will provide you with the contract address.

- Copy the smart contract address from the `address` field
![result](/img/Contract_Address.png)

- Export your smart contract address:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    export CONTRACT_ADDRESS="YOUR_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS e.g. 2LUmicHyH4RXrMjG4beDwuDsiWJESyLkgkwPdGTR8kahRzq5XS"
    ```
