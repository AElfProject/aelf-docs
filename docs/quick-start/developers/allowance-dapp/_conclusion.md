## 🎯 Conclusion

🎉 Congratulations on completing the **Allowance dApp** tutorial! 🎉 You’ve taken significant steps in setting up your development environment, building and deploying two smart contracts, and creating a fully functional Allowance dApp on the aelf blockchain. 🌟

**📚 What You've Learned**

Throughout this tutorial, you've mastered:

- **🛠️ Setting Up Your Development Environment:** You prepared your workspace by installing and configuring all the necessary tools to kickstart your smart contract project.

- **💻 Developing the Role Smart Contract:** You created a Role contract that defines roles and permissions, including Admin, Parent, and Child roles, which allow users to interact according to assigned roles.

- **💻 Developing the Allowance Smart Contract:** You built the Allowance contract to enable Parents to set spending limits for Children, creating the foundation of a decentralized allowance management system.

- **🚀 Deploying Both Smart Contracts:** You deployed both contracts to the aelf blockchain, enabling your dApp to use the features in a live environment.

- **🔧 Interacting with Your Deployed Smart Contract:**  You connected the dApp frontend to the blockchain, integrated Portkey for wallet connectivity, and set up functions for managing roles and allowances directly through the dApp interface.

**🔍 Final Output**

By now, you should have:

- 📜 **Two deployed smart contracts** — one for managing user roles (Admin, Parent, and Child) and another for setting and managing allowances within the dApp.

- 💻 **A fully functional Allowance dApp** — allowing users to assign roles, set allowances, and spend funds within set limits, all through a secure and intuitive interface.

**➡️ What's Next?**

With the foundation in place, consider exploring advanced topics:

- **📈 Enhancing Smart Contract Logic:** Add new features, such as notifications for spending limits, allowance resets, or reports on spending habits.

- **🔒 Improving Security:** Ensure your dApp and smart contract are secure by implementing best practices and security measures.

- **🌍 Exploring Cross-Chain Features:** Expand your dApp’s reach by exploring aelf’s cross-chain interoperability, enabling interactions with other blockchain networks

You’ve now acquired the tools to take your Allowance dApp to the next level! Keep building, innovating, and exploring with aelf. 🚀

Happy coding and growing your **Allowance dApp! 😊**
