# aelf 2025 Roadmap: Introduction

This roadmap outlines aelf's strategic advancements in core blockchain technology, focusing on modularity, distributed computing, and AI integration.

## Q1 2025

### Core Modules: Consensus and Data Availability

aelf will abstract the consensus and data availability functionalities into modular components. This allows flexibility for developers to either use default implementations or leverage standardised interfaces to build tailored solutions. 

### Exploring and Integrating Cutting-Edge Blockchain Architectures

aelf will actively incorporate advanced blockchain architectures, such as BlockDAG (this is a potential layer of technology to be explored) into its modular framework. These architectures offer innovative solutions to scalability and concurrency challenges often faced by traditional blockchain structures.

## Q2 2025

### Modular Execution and Consensus 

Extend modularity to the execution and [consensus layers](https://blog.aelf.com/posts/blockchain-guide-consensus-mechanism-types-ai), enabling developers to leverage default implementations or build custom solutions via standardised interfaces. 

This enhances flexibility and future-proofs the blockchain for next-phase advancements in Web3 AI technology.

### Customisable Blockchain Assembly 

Proof-of-Concept (PoC) validation for dynamically loading custom module components at runtime, specified through configuration files. 

This empowers developers to tailor the blockchain to specific use cases and experiment with novel configurations.

### AI Intent Recognition and Automated Execution 

Introduce an AI-powered layer that automates complex Web3 and crypto interactions. 

By recognising user intents, the Web3 AI system can execute tasks like signing, contract calls, and fee settlements without manual intervention, improving user experience and efficiency.

## Q3 2025

### Fully Operational Modular Blockchain 

Finalise core functionalities of execution, consensus, data availability, and settlement modules, including extensions, to achieve a comprehensive and operational blockchain.

### Pluggable Module Integration 

Enable the development and seamless integration of custom and extended modules into the modular blockchain architecture, further enhancing flexibility and customisation.

### Cloud-Native Deployment 

Deploy the modular blockchain on a cloud-native architecture, leveraging scalable and distributed computing resources to optimise performance and resource allocation.

### AI Privacy and Security 

Integrate privacy-enhancing technologies like [zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)](https://blog.aelf.com/posts/understanding-zkp-in-blockchain-comparison) and homomorphic encryption to ensure user data security and privacy, even with automated AI operations.

## Q4 2025

### Complete Modular Blockchain

Finalise development of all remaining modules, including governance, economic models, permissions, and security, to establish a fully functional and modular blockchain system.

### Cloud-Native AI Integration

Enhance DevOps interoperability through AI integration. AI-powered monitoring and automated scaling within the cloud-native environment will also optimise efficiency and ensure high availability.

### Pluggable AI Engine

Empower developers to integrate diverse [AI models](https://blog.aelf.com/posts/comprehensive-guide-ai-agent-types), such as LLMs and graph neural networks, for specialised scenarios like complex cross-chain interactions and smart contract logic suggestions.
