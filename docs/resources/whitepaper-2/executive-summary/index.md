[aelf](https://aelf.com/) is a cutting-edge multi-chain blockchain framework launched in December 2017, utilising the powerful C# programming language. Its multi-layered structure, featuring MainChain and SideChains, effectively tackles the challenges of traditional blockchain systems, such as performance bottlenecks and data complexity. This architecture improves scalability and reduces congestion by distributing tasks across multiple chains. With an emphasis on developer customisation and parallel processing, aelf's framework is versatile, supporting a wide range of applications from digital asset management to DeFi.

In aelf's Whitepaper 2.0, the mission is to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance its operational efficiency. AI-driven machine learning models optimise smart contract execution and gas usage, predict network congestion, and dynamically adjust resources to ensure high performance. Additionally, AI enables intelligent load balancing and predictive scaling, ensuring efficient traffic distribution and resource utilisation throughout the network. Separately, the aelf AI Oracle aims to advance the AI Dapp ecosystem on aelf by optimising the SDK and framework for better interaction capabilities and strengthening collaborations with AI Agent platforms. 

For developers, aelf provides an AI-enhanced environment that simplifies smart contract creation with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and offers real-time support through AI-powered chatbots. These tools make blockchain technology more accessible to non-technical users and streamline the development process for experienced developers. In aelf's AI-based smart contract auditing, smart contract code is input into aelf's pre-trained model to analyse syntax and logical structure, identifying security vulnerabilities and errors, and generating a detailed audit report with remediation suggestions for aelf developers before deploying their smart contracts on the aelf chain. By incorporating AI, aelf not only improves the user experience but also expands its user base, fostering adoption and innovation in the blockchain space. 

Beyond AI, aelf will be introducing a new modular Layer 2 chain utilising ZK Rollup technology that  would significantly enhance aelf's performance, scalability, and EVM compatibility. This approach will reduce Layer 1 gas storage costs, lower transaction costs for users, and ultimately improves privacy and the user experience.

Ultimately, aelf is a versatile multi-chain blockchain framework that enhances efficiency and scalability through a multi-layered architecture, AI integration, and modular Layer 2 ZK Rollup technology, making it highly efficient, secure, and developer-friendly.
