## Smart Contracts Overview

This section helps you learn to write smart contracts. It will take about 40 minutes to complete. Follow the steps and examples to set up your development environment using C# and AElf-developer-tools. You'll learn to develop, test, and deploy/update smart contracts.

There are two types of smart contract deployment/update:
1. Requires approval from a BP.
2. Does not require approval.

The tutorials explain when to use each type.

Blockchain platforms are like a shared database storing the status of all deployed smart contracts. Each smart contract gets a unique address upon deployment. This address is used to check the contract's execution status and acts as an identifier for queries and updates. The contract code details how to verify permissions and complete operations.

### Development Steps
1. Set up the development environment.
2. Develop the smart contract.
3. Test the smart contract.
4. Deploy or update the smart contract.

### Deployment/Update Types
- **With BP Approval**: Needed in certain scenarios.
- **Without BP Approval**: Used in other scenarios.

This overview provides a basic understanding to get started with smart contracts on the AElf platform.
