## 1. Overview

AetherLink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data and external APIs. It provides highly reliable and tamper-proof data inputs, which are essential for executing smart contracts that rely on off-chain information. AetherLink is built with security in mind, using decentralized node operators to prevent single points of failure, ensuring data integrity through multiple data sources, and offering verifiable randomness for enhanced transparency. Additionally, AetherLink is designed to be highly scalable, supporting a wide range of use cases from decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming and beyond.

AetherLink offers several key products that enhance the functionality of smart contracts:

1. Datafeeds: AetherLink Datafeeds provide decentralized, real-time data from multiple sources, enabling smart contracts to access highly reliable and accurate off-chain information, such as asset prices, for secure decision-making in decentralized applications.
2. VRF (Verifiable Random Function): AetherLink VRF delivers provably fair and verifiable random numbers, ensuring the randomness used in smart contracts is tamper-proof and transparent. This is particularly useful for gaming, lotteries, and any application that requires trusted randomness.
3. Automation: AetherLink Automation allows developers to automate smart contract functions by triggering actions based on specific events or conditions. This reduces the need for manual intervention and ensures contracts execute efficiently and reliably when certain criteria are met.
4. CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol): AetherLink's CCIP enables seamless communication and interaction between different blockchains, allowing smart contracts to operate across multiple networks. This interoperability expands the capabilities of decentralized applications, making them more versatile and powerful.

## 2. Purpose

The go-to place for developers who want to learn how to build applications using AetherLink Contract.

## 3. What's Next?

You have now understood the basic functions of Oracle. Next, you can choose the appropriate Oracle product based on your scenario to make your DApp contract more secure and efficient.
